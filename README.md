# TruthTable
A toy truth table generator.

# Usage
Type in a logical statement, with lowercase Latin letters representing variables, and use ! | & -> <-> to represent their relationship.

It's just a toy so there is no sorting or other stuffs like that and the implementation is garbage and the result is very ugly.
